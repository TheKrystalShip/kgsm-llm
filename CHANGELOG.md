## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- `command.proposed` SSE frames now carry an optional `instanceName` for the `install` verb — the
  custom name a user asked for. `subject.id` is the blueprint for an install, so the name rides its
  own field; a surface that installs via an API endpoint passes it through so a named install lands
  the requested name instead of silently dropping it.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- Initial versioned release.
