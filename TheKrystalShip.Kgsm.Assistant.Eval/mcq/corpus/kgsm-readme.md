# KGSM - Krystal Game Server Manager

[![License: GPL-3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL--3.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A lightweight, powerful tool for managing game servers on Linux with minimal hassle.

## What is KGSM?

KGSM simplifies setting up and managing game servers on Linux. Whether you're hosting a casual Minecraft server for friends or running a dedicated Valheim community, KGSM handles the technical details so you can focus on playing games.

**Key Features:**
- **Simple Management** - Install, update, and manage servers through an intuitive interface
- **Flexible Deployment** - Native Linux or Docker container support
- **Automation-Ready** - Full CLI for scripting
- **Low Overhead** - Minimalist design keeps resource usage low

## Installation

### Arch Linux

KGSM is published as a signed pacman package in the KGSM repository. Point pacman at the
repository and its signing key once — the block is in
[`kgsm-meta`](https://github.com/TheKrystalShip/kgsm-meta#installing-a-node) — then:

```sh
pacman -S kgsm
```

The package installs the engine to `/opt/kgsm` and symlinks it onto `PATH` as
`/usr/bin/kgsm`, and pulls in everything it needs. Upgrades are `pacman -Syu`.

### From Source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheKrystalShip/KGSM.git
cd KGSM
./kgsm.sh --help
```

### Dependencies

**Required:**
```sh
grep jq wget unzip tar sed coreutils findutils steamcmd inotify-tools
```

**Optional:**
| Package     | Purpose             | Config Setting                    |
| ----------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `ufw`   | Firewall management | `enable_firewall_management=true` |
| `socat` | Event handling      | `enable_event_broadcasting=true`  |
